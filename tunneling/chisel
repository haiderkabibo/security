chisel 

chisel is program to port forwarding so you install client in remote machine and install server in your machine so every local port in client you can rich it from server

for example 


remote machine : windows : have mysql local port 3306 
local machine : linux : need to access port 3306 from outside 

steps : 
1- in local machine "linux" 
  chisel server --reverse --port 5000

2- in remote machine "windows"
   chisel client "ip for remote server"linux"" R:<local-port>:<remote-host>:<remote-port>/
                                               R: 3306:localhost:3306
3- in local machine , connect to mysql 

mysql -u user -p password -h localhost
