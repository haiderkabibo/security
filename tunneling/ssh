~C  to get to command mode in ssh 



to tunnel via ssh use -D8877(port number)
use proxychains conf file to make sock5 proxy 
sock5 localip port 

after that use proxychains command 


now all traffic with this command will go through box with ssh 






-L port:host:hostport
pecifies that connections to the given TCP port on the local (client) host are to be forwarded to the given host and port
ex:ssh -L 4433:127.0.0.1:5000 so by this every request in attacker machine in port 4433 will forwaded to localhost (127.0.0.1) and port 5000 on target machine
