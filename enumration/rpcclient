rpcclient 

rpcclient -U 'user%password' ip 

  with this and if you have account for smb you can do alot of enumration 
  for users 
  1-lookupnames "name of a user" in the general use administrator user 
    lookupname administartor :
     you will get a SID for administartor 
     thats will end with 500

    IN OUR CASE WE WILL USE A NAME OF USER OF SMB AND GET SID FOR HIM
    2- now we will increase the SID for the user by one to get all users 
       so type : lookupsid "SID+1"
         so if it was 123123-123123-234234-'1009'
         the command will be  : lookupsid 123123-123123-234234-'1010'



and banch banch banch of functions you must test it
