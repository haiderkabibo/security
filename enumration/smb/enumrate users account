enumrate users account 
IPPSEC Hiest
if you have a login credintial for smb account for some user so to enumrate another accounts by 

1- impacket-lookupsid :
A security identifier (SID) is a unique value of variable length that is used to identify a security principal (such as a security group) in Windows operating systems. SIDs that identify generic users or generic groups is well known. Their values remain constant across all operating systems.

so for every user is a uniq SID so with this tool you can enumrate al users by get the SID for the user you log in and increase it by one

lookupsid 'name:password'@ip




2- use rpcclient

  rpcclient -U 'user%password' ip 

  with this and if you have account for smb you can do alot of enumration 
  for users 
  1-lookupnames "name of a user" in the general use administrator user 
    lookupname administartor :
     you will get a SID for administartor 
     thats will end with 500

    IN OUR CASE WE WILL USE A NAME OF USER OF SMB AND GET SID FOR HIM
    2- now we will increase the SID for the user by one to get all users 
       so type : lookupsid "SID+1"
         so if it was 123123-123123-234234-'1009'
         the command will be  : lookupsid 123123-123123-234234-'1010'
